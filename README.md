This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Assumptions & Decisions
- This is a small, single-page app, so I used a components/ folder instead of a features/ structure.

- If the project were to grow (e.g., filters, search, admin dashboard), Iâ€™d consider splitting by feature/module.
