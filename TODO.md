## üìå Project Goal (What You‚Äôre Building)

A simple job board app using:

- **TypeScript**
- **ReactJS / Next.js**
- **Tailwind**, **SASS**, or **plain CSS** (your choice)

### Requirements:
- Display job listings in **card format**
- Must be **responsive** (mobile to desktop)

---

## ‚úÖ Your Tasks

- Build **reusable components**:
  - `JobCard`
  - `JobList`
  - (Optional) `Layout`

- **Fetch job data** from a `.json` file placed in the **public** folder (not imported)
- Display jobs using your `JobCard` component
- Ensure **responsive design** ‚Äî looks good on all screen sizes
- **Style** according to the **provided design**

---

## ‚úÖ Design File

Check the format:
- Is it **Figma**, **PDF**, or **images**?

Check if they provide:
- Fonts
- Colors
- Spacing and layout sizes (e.g., padding, margin)

If it‚Äôs **Figma**:
- Right-click ‚Üí **Inspect** to get exact CSS or Tailwind values

---

## ‚úÖ Fetching Data

They specifically said:

> "Place the data file in the public folder and fetch the data rather than importing the JSON file directly."

Use the `fetch()` API:

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('/jobs.json')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => setJobs(data));
}, []);
```

---

## ‚úÖ Deliverables

A working app that:

- Displays the **data**
- Looks like the **design**
- Works across **screen sizes**

And also:

- A **ZIP file** of the entire project (excluding `node_modules`)
- A **README** or instructions:
  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
  # URL: http://localhost:3000
  ```

---

## ‚úÖ Evaluation Criteria

- Functionality
- Code Quality
- Responsiveness
- Architecture (modular, organized)
- Following instructions (e.g., how you fetched data)

---

## ‚ùìThings to Check Now:

- Do you have access to the **design file**?
- Is there a **jobs.json** file or similar for data?
- Any other folders or **special instructions** in the package?
- Are there **mobile + desktop** designs?
